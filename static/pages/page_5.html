  <h2>NATO Phonetic Alphabet</h2>
  <p>Utilizing the Phonetic Alphabet is very important when sharing
    information to other units to make sure every letter is heard
    clearly. <br><br>
    Most cases the Phonetic Alphabet will be used when reading out
    Vehicle Plates to other units or Dispatch. Can also be used in
    other situations like describing suspects.

  <h2>How do you use the radio?</h2>

  <h3>Seting up the radio</h3>
  <p>Navigate to the following <b>F9 => Type in the communication channel desired => Click the connect icon</b>.</p>
  <img src="static/images/RADIO.jpg" alt="">
  <br>

  <h3>RTO - Radio Traffic Only</h3>
  <p>Keep all traffic to 10 Codes and short descriptions
    only. Radio Transmissions should be kept to a
    minimum length in order to prevent the radio from
    becoming backed up with unnecessary traffic. All
    Radio Traffic should be clear, succinct, and
    concise.</p>

  <h3>Signal 100 - Priority RTO</h3>
  <p>If you hear any unit calling in priority traffic, hold your
    traffic. This is especially important in the middle of a
    priority situation. Even though the events in-game may
    be extremely hectic, it is vital not to have multiple
    people speaking at one time. One unit at a time should
    be relaying all the necessary to dispatch about the
    priority. During a priority in most cases the active
    Dispatcher will put the RTO in a Signal 100 meaning all
    Radio traffic should be in reference to the current
    priority.</p>

  <h3>RTO Notes</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Maintain RTO at all times
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep radio traffic to a minimum. When talking on the radio, it's critical not to talk over other officers and
      dispatchers </li>
    <li>
      It is important not to yell or laugh into the mic. Remain calm during your transmissions so information is
      correctly understood. </li>
    <li>
      You can modify the volume of the radio on the dial above the menu. </li>
