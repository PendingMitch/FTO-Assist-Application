    A traffic stop is making contact with a vehicle for one of
    multiple reasons. (Speeding, Reckless Driving,
    Unroadworthy vehicle or any Traffic Violation)

  <h2>How to conduct a traffic stop</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Gather information whilst behind the vehicle - vehicle description, plate, occupancy, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the vehicle has stopped - notify dispatch of the location and the information mentioned previously. Note
      whether additionals are needed.
    </li>
    <li>
      After you have notified dispatch of your traffic stop, you should proceed to the vehicle.
      <br>
      Make sure you pay attention to how close you are to the road and if it is safest to approach on the driver or
      passenger side.
      <br>
      - Your safety is a priority here pay attention to your surroundings as well as the subject.
    </li>

    <li>
      Now that you have made initial contact with the subject Introduce yourself then explain why you stopped them
      today. Once you've notified him of the reason you need to collect information, this includes license,
      registration and proof of insurance.
    </li>
    <li>
      After you receive their information, you need to go back to your vehicle to run their name. Due to what you find
      is how you'll react next. If they are clean continue with the traffic stop. If they have something patchy such
      as suspended licensing or a felony warrant you need to adjust accordingly.

    <li>
      Resuming normally, now that you have their information and ran it, you need to begin writing the citation on
      CAD. After your citation(s) are written, you need to re-approach the subject and issue him the ticket and state
      what it is for.

      After issuing the citation, you need to allow them to sign the ticket where is says “Percipient Signature.” and
      state the following “Signing this is not an admission of guilt. It just states that you have received the ticket
      and will pay the fine within 30 days.”
