      Most cases the Phonetic Alphabet will be used when reading out

    <h2>How do you use the radio?</h2>  

    <h3>Seting up the radio</h3>
    <p>Navigate to the following <b>F9 => Type in the communication channel desired => Click the connect icon</b>.</p>
    <img src="static/images/RADIO.jpg" alt="">
    <br>

    <h3>RTO - Radio Traffic Only</h3>
    <p>Keep all traffic to 10 Codes and short descriptions
      only. Radio Transmissions should be kept to a
      minimum length in order to prevent the radio from
      becoming backed up with unnecessary traffic. All
      Radio Traffic should be clear, succinct, and
      concise.</p>

    <h3>Signal 100 - Priority RTO</h3>
    <p>If you hear any unit calling in priority traffic, hold your
      traffic. This is especially important in the middle of a
      priority situation. Even though the events in-game may
      be extremely hectic, it is vital not to have multiple
      people speaking at one time. One unit at a time should
      be relaying all the necessary to dispatch about the
      priority. During a priority in most cases the active
      Dispatcher will put the RTO in a Signal 100 meaning all
      Radio traffic should be in reference to the current
      priority.</p>

      <h3>RTO Notes</h3>
      <p>1. Maintain RTO at all times
        <br>
        2. Keep radio traffic to a minimum. When talking on the radio, it's critical not to talk over other officers and dispatchers <br>
        3. It is important not to yell or laugh into the mic. Remain calm during your transmissions so information is correctly understood. <br>
        4. You can modify the volume of the radio on the dial above the menu. <br>
        5. Common radio channels are as followed:
